# Magento2-SearchRefinement
Transform Magento2's out of the box search behavior to 'Refinement' when searching with multiple terms.

This free extension changes the search results behaviour of Magento 2.x to show a more restrictive result set than the one that is available out of the box. Search changes from default 'OR' to 'AND' when using a search phrase with multiple words.
